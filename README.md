# Weather check

# Note: Free open weather Api plan is only allowing to get 5 day data with 3 hour intervals.

## Libraries used:

1. React with Hooks (I also Know Redux.js)
2. Material UI
3. Recharts
4. node-sass to enable sass support (I also know styled components)

## Comments:

1. Due to the scope and less complexity of the test, I am using latest version of React with Hooks and wrote all functional components.

2. But If using Redux is mandatory, then I would love to use redux.js and will resubmit the test accordingly.
